# image-classification
In this project,I classified image cifar 10 dataset from tensorflow keras datasets.There are total 10 classes and I used CNN for classification.It contains 50000 training images and 1000 test images.Normalizing the images to a number from 0 to 1.Image has 3 channels (R,G,B) and each value in the channel can range from 0 to 255.Hence,to normalize in 0->1 range,I divided it by 255.After this ,I build a simple simple artificial neural network for image classificatiom with 5 epochs and then 
I build a convolutional neural network for image classification with epochs 5 and then I build a convolutional neural network  to train our images .With CNN,at the end 5 epochs accuracy was around 70% which is significant improvement over ANN.Also,computation is much less compared tosimple ANN as max pooling reduces the image dimensions while still preserving the features.
